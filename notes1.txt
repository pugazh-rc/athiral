      inside the interface we can create variable by declaring as final and static.

FuctionalInterface

 Any interface with a SAM(Single Abstract Method) is a functional interface

lambdaExpression 

Any interface with a SAM(Single Abstract Method) is a functional interface, and its implementation may be treated as lambda expressions
it is used to reduce the code.

try block - it is used to perform the critical statement
catch block - it is used to catch the exception thrown by try block
finally block - it is used to close the resource or declare a new comment
